# creatorSupport
Allows Sponetize creators to display their sponsorships as ads on their web projects with a simple JavaScript SDK. `sarah.js` is human readable, `indigo.js` is obscuified (which can get around some adblockers).

Current creators can refer to [Sponetize](https://sponetize.marshallsmom.com) for implementation information.
